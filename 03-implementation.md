# Basic Implementation


## Impure Implementations

- Formal language theory is pretty
- The real world is not pretty
- HTML, XML, etc are not regular languages
- Oh, and backtracking


## Anatomy of a Regex

- delimiter (/, #, ~, @, etc)
- literal characters
- special characters
- modifiers


## Language Differences
