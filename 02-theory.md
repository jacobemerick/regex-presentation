# The Theory of Regular Expressions


## Formal Language Theory

If an alphabet is a finite set of symbols, you can create an infinite set of strings (Kleene Closure) using those symbols. Any arbitrary subset of these strings (a language) cannot be determined by computing.

*However, they may be defined.*


## Language Definition Language

- All possible characters
- Unions
- Grouping
- Concatenation
- Kleene Closure


## Regular Expression Language

A language is a regular language if it can be described using only these parameters
